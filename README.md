# news-classification
Give me the good news! During dark and gloomy times like today, the hope is that good news can bring some cheer. This project aims to train a classifier to distinguish between good and bad news.

First, the data was collected and assembled into a .csv file using scripts from [/datacollection](https://github.com/aman527/news-classification/tree/master/datacollection). It was cleaned in `Data Cleaning.ipynb`, and currently I'm working on training a classifier on the data in `Sentiment Analysis.ipynb`.
